                                                        We all know a famous quotation “Knowledge is power” but it is a wrong
                                                        assumption. Knowledge is only potential power. It completely becomes
                                                        power only when it is organized into definite plans of actions.{" "}
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        For example : You are learning a programming language like C. Then
                                                        without stopping learning, continue your learning process by updating
                                                        your programming skills by learning new programming languages which are
                                                        in real time demand. Research about it and start learning.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Then dont leave it there itself, start doing projects on the learned
                                                        concepts. Theoretical concepts do not provide complete knowledge on the
                                                        subject so we have to put it into the form of the action.{" "}
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        If you learn only the theoretical concepts there is a chance of even
                                                        forgetting the concept. So a student must have both theoretical and
                                                        practical knowledge. This blog is written by taking the reference from
                                                        the famous book “Think and grow rich” written by “Napoleon Hill”. In
                                                        that book the author categorized the knowledge into 2 divisions. One is
                                                        general knowledge and the other is specialized knowledge. We all know
                                                        that general knowledge is nothing but knowing the information about the
                                                        facts in the universe which may be related to history, science,
                                                        politics, culture, mythology etc.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But having the general knowledge, irrespective of the amount of it,
                                                        leads to a small number of earnings from it. Having General knowledge is
                                                        not a bad thing but depending only on the general knowledge may not help
                                                        to earn more money. Knowledge has no value until it is utilized and
                                                        organized in the proper way. When we dont execute what we have learnt
                                                        into a proper action only 80 percent of the knowledge is acquired.
                                                        Thats why NAPOLEON HILL in his book mentioned clearly stating that
                                                        education system is missing one link and that is how to teach students
                                                        ``HOW TO ORGANIZE AND USE KNOWLEDGE AFTER THEY ACQUIRE IT”Students
                                                        nowadays are facing the same issue and many graduates are jobless due to
                                                        the reason they are not taught how to use their knowledge in earning
                                                        money in an organized way.

                                                            In todays generations the meaning for the word education has totally
                                                            changed because of lack of practical knowledge. Along with practical
                                                            knowledge a person should also have specialized knowledge. In the book
                                                            written by “NAPOLEON HILL” the author gave importance to specialized
                                                            knowledge in chapter 5. According to the specialized knowledge, any
                                                            man is educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs it and
                                                            how to organize that knowledge into definite plans of action
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            So specialized knowledge is a combination of both theoretical
                                                            knowledge and practical knowledge, where the theoretical knowledge is
                                                            acquired from gathering knowledge from different sources and
                                                            organizing that knowledge into a definite plan of action is obviously
                                                            having practical knowledge. So every student should have specialized
                                                            knowledge.

                                                            information, but in case of specialized knowledge we dont have to
                                                            remember information, we should only have an idea regarding the source
                                                            where we can get the possible solution for your related question.{" "}

                                                        Henry Ford won the case against him, which was filed calling him an
                                                        “ignorant pacifist”. During the court discussion Henry Ford proved
                                                        himself that he was not an ignorant pacifist by saying that “why should
                                                        I clutter my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able
                                                        to answer the questions, when I have men around me who can supply any
                                                        knowledge I require?” With this answer, everyone realized that Henry
                                                        Ford is not an ignorant pacifist but he is a man of education.{" "}

                                                            from the sources then why should we have general knowledge.{" "}

                                                            knowledge. So we must inculcate the habit of developing specialized
