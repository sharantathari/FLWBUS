                                                        A person who score’s less might have more knowledge than a top graded
                                                        student in their class. Constantly calling him dumb or putting more
                                                        pressure on the student might effect their logical thinking. Treating
                                                        low scored students in a different manner will effect the child
                                                        subconsciously. All students might not be thinking in a similar way.
                                                        knowledge Cannot be measured by scores.

                                                        Few students might have good knowledge in regular subjects whereas other
                                                        students might have good knowledge in other subjects or extra curricular
                                                        activities. Albert Einstein says ” Everybody have equal knowledge. But
                                                        if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, then it will live
                                                        its entire life believing that it is dumb.” Instead of putting pressure
                                                        on students, identifying their strengths &amp; interests and encouraging
                                                        them would create a positive impact on the student.

                                                        According to a survey, There are more than 250 student suicide cases per
                                                        year. This happens Because of the ill treatment of the students at
                                                        schools and home based on their scores. psychologists say that being
                                                        rude or harsh with students might lead them to depression.{" "}

                                                        Hence, we need to consider that all the students have equal knowledge
                                                        and treat them with love &amp; care. There are many students who are
                                                        always willing to learn and improve their knowledge but due to lack of
                                                        resources they are not keeping upto the mark.

                                                        few students might even be afraid to go and ask their doubts to teachers
                                                        or fellow students as they might tease them.
